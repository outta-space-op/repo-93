# Working with Events

## Learning Goals

- Practice test-driven development (TDD)
- Practice finding elements using accessible query methods
- Use the user-event library to simulate events in tests
- Test changes to component state in response to user events

## Introduction

In this lesson, you'll get additional practice using test-driven development and
writing tests using Jest and React Testing Library. You'll expand on the tools
you've already used, and learn how to write tests that simulate a user event and
verify that the component is updated as expected. To do this, we'll use the
[`user-event` library][user-event], which allows us to simulate user events
(clicks, keyboard events, etc.) in our tests.

The `user-event` library is a great tool because it follows React Testing
Library's philosophy of writing our tests to mirror how a user would interact
with our components in the real world. It also encourages writing tests that
don't test implementation details. We'll see when we start writing tests that we
never actually check the internals of our component (like whether or not state
was updated). All we do is check what the UI looks like before and after
triggering an event, and verify that the event caused some part of our UI to
change in an expected way.

## Getting Started

For this lesson, we're going to build a simple online ordering system for a
pizza parlor. We'll keep it simple to start, with just two choices: cheese (the
default) or pepperoni. We'll use test-driven development to build an interface
that allows customers to select pepperoni (or not) using a checkbox. We also
want to display the list of selected toppings on the page so the customer is
confident that their selection is recognized.

Fork and clone this repo and run `npm install`. We'll be doing our coding in
`App.js` and `__tests__/App.test.js`. Go ahead and run `npm start`, and open a
second tab to run `npm test`. At this point, you'll see an error because our
test file is empty.

## Creating the App

Before we start coding, let's think about what our app should look like. We want
a page with some type of heading ("Select Pizza Toppings", say) and a checkbox
that will enable the user to add pepperoni to their pizza if they choose. Below
that, we'll want to display a list of the selected toppings. That list should
initially have "Cheese" as the only topping, and should update to include
"Pepperoni" if the user clicks the checkbox. Finally, we should make sure that
if users change their mind, they can remove pepperoni by clicking the checkbox a
second time.

In general, when writing tests for user events, we want to do the following:

1. Verify that the initial state of the page is what we want
2. Simulate a user event (in this case, clicking the checkbox)
3. Verify that the state of the page updates as expected

Let's update our `App.test.js` file with some comments laying out how we're
going to proceed:

```jsx
// __tests__App.test.js

import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "../App";

// Test the initial state of the page

// Test the effect of clicking the checkbox

// Test the effect of clicking the checkbox a second time
```

### Initial State

We want to include two different tests for the initial state:

```jsx
...
// Test the initial state of the page

test("pizza checkbox is initially unchecked", () => {})

test("toppings list initially contains only cheese", () => {})
...
```

To test that the checkbox is initially unchecked, we'll first need to find that
component on the page, then check its status. We'll use `getByRole` to find the
component. We already have `render` and `screen` imported, so we can find the
checkbox and check its initial status as follows:

```jsx
test("pizza checkbox is initially unchecked", () => {
  render(<App />);

  const addPepperoni = screen.getByRole("checkbox", { name: /add pepperoni/i });

  expect(addPepperoni).not.toBeChecked();
});
```

Here we're looking for an element with the role "checkbox" and the name "Add
pepperoni" and saving it to the `addPepperoni` variable. We then use the
`toBeChecked` [`jest-dom` matcher][jest-dom] chained to the `not` matcher to
verify that the box is initially unchecked.

Once you've added the code above and clicked save, you'll see that our first
test is failing. Looking at the error, we see that the test can't find our
`addPepperoni` element, which isn't surprising given that we haven't coded it
yet. This is the "red" phase of the "red/green/refactor" cycle. So the next step
is to write the code to get this test passing.

If we check the [MDN ARIA Reference for checkbox][aria-checkbox] to ensure that
we're coding our app with accessibility in mind, we see that we should create a
native HTML checkbox element (`<input type="checkbox">`) and include both an
`aria-checked` attribute and a label. For now, we can simply set the initial
checked status of the checkbox to `false`.

The setup below follows the accessibility guidelines and should enable the
`getByRole` query we wrote in our tests to find the element:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Select Pizza Toppings</h1>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        id="pepperoni"
        checked={false}
        aria-checked={false}
      />
      <label htmlFor="pepperoni">Add pepperoni</label>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

With the code above, you'll see that our test is now passing! (You'll also see a
warning â€” we'll address that in a bit.) If you have the server running, you can
also verify in the browser that the checkbox is present and unchecked.

Now that we've got the first "initial state" test passing, let's work on the
second one:

```jsx
// Test the initial state of the page
test("toppings list initially contains only cheese", () => {});
```

We'll be creating an unordered list of the pizza ingredients, and we want to
check what items it includes. Checking the [MDN - ARIA Role Reference][mdn-aria]
again, we see that the [`listitem` role][aria-listitem] will identify `li`
elements inside a `ul` or `ol` element. We can use this along with
`getAllByRole` to access all the `li`s on our page, and verify that initially
there is only one:

```jsx
test("toppings list initially contains only cheese", () => {
  render(<App />);

  expect(screen.getAllByRole("listitem").length).toBe(1);
});
```

However, we also want to verify that the _text_ of the `li` matches what we're
expecting ("Cheese"). To do this, we'll need to add another query that uses
`getByText`:

```jsx
expect(screen.getByText("Cheese")).toBeInTheDocument();
```

Finally, we can explicitly check that "Pepperoni" is _not_ included on the page.
We can't use `getByText` in this case because the test will throw an error.
We'll use `queryByText` instead, which will return `null` if the element isn't
found:

```jsx
expect(screen.queryByText("Pepperoni")).not.toBeInTheDocument();
```

Our test should now look like this:

```jsx
test("toppings list initially contains only cheese", () => {
  render(<App />);

  expect(screen.getAllByRole("listitem").length).toBe(1);
  expect(screen.getByText("Cheese")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.queryByText("Pepperoni")).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Save the file and check the tests and you'll see that, as expected, our second
test is failing. So the next step is to write the code for our list of toppings.
Since "Cheese" is the default topping, we can simply hard code it into the list:

```jsx
...
<label htmlFor="pepperoni">Add pepperoni</label>

<h2>Your Toppings:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cheese</li>
</ul>
```

Once you've added this code, the second test should be passing, and the list
should now appear in the browser.

### Clicking the Checkbox

The behavior we expect when the user clicks the "Add Pepperoni" checkbox is:

1. The checkbox will appear checked in the DOM
2. Pepperoni will be added to the list of toppings

So let's create those two tests:

```jsx
// Test the effect of clicking the checkbox
test("checkboxes become checked when user clicks them", () => {});

test("topping appears in toppings list when checked", () => {});
```

For the first test, we first need to render the app and find the checkbox, just
as we did before:

```jsx
test("checkboxes become checked when user clicks them", () => {
  render(<App />);

  const addPepperoni = screen.getByRole("checkbox", { name: /add pepperoni/i });
});
```

We can then use the `user-event` `click` event to simulate the user clicking the
checkbox. We'll need to import the `userEvent` object first:

```jsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event"; // Added import
import App from "../App";
```

Then we can use it to click the checkbox:

```jsx
test("checkboxes become checked when user clicks them", () => {
  render(<App />);

  const addPepperoni = screen.getByRole("checkbox", { name: /add pepperoni/i });
  userEvent.click(addPepperoni);
});
```

And, finally, verify that the checkbox is now checked:

```jsx
expect(addPepperoni).toBeChecked();
```

The full test looks like this:

```jsx
// Test the effect of clicking the checkbox
test("checkbox appears as checked when user clicks it", () => {
  render(<App />);

  const addPepperoni = screen.getByRole("checkbox", { name: /add pepperoni/i });

  userEvent.click(addPepperoni);
  expect(addPepperoni).toBeChecked();
});
```

With this, we're ready to start writing the code. To get it working we'll need
to:

- Add state to keep track of the status of the checkbox
- Use the state variable to control the checkbox's `checked` and `aria-checked`
  properties
- Create a callback function to update state when the checkbox is clicked
- Add an `onChange` property to the `input` and assign the callback as the
  handler

The updated code should look like this:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [pepperoniIsChecked, setPepperoniIsChecked] = useState(false);

  function togglePepperoni(e) {
    setPepperoniIsChecked(e.target.checked);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Select Pizza Toppings</h1>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        id="pepperoni"
        checked={pepperoniIsChecked}
        aria-checked={pepperoniIsChecked}
        onChange={togglePepperoni}
      />
      <label htmlFor="pepperoni">Add pepperoni</label>

      <h2>Your Toppings:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cheese</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The third test is now passing, and the warning we've been getting should be gone
as well. On to the next one!

```jsx
test("topping appears in toppings list when checked", () => {});
```

For this, we can reuse our second test, with just a couple of changes.
Specifically, we now expect to see two list items rather than one, and we expect
"Pepperoni" to appear in the list:

```jsx
test("topping appears in toppings list when checked", () => {
  render(<App />);

  const addPepperoni = screen.getByRole("checkbox", { name: /add pepperoni/i });

  userEvent.click(addPepperoni);

  expect(screen.getAllByRole("listitem").length).toBe(2);
  expect(screen.getByText("Cheese")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText("Pepperoni")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Then, to add that functionality to our app, we'll use a simple ternary:

```jsx
  <h2>Your Toppings:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    {pepperoniIsChecked ? <li>Pepperoni</li> : null}
  </ul>
```

Our code is now complete! Just to be sure everything works as intended, however,
let's also verify that we can toggle the checkbox on and off and that the page
updates to match.

To do this we simply need to add a new test and use two `userEvent.click` events
in our test to verify that clicking the checkbox a second time removes the
"Pepperoni" item from the page:

```jsx
test("selected topping disappears when checked a second time", () => {
  render(<App />);

  const addPepperoni = screen.getByRole("checkbox", { name: /add pepperoni/i });

  userEvent.click(addPepperoni);

  expect(addPepperoni).toBeChecked();
  expect(screen.getByText("Cheese")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText("Pepperoni")).toBeInTheDocument();

  userEvent.click(addPepperoni);

  expect(addPepperoni).not.toBeChecked();
  expect(screen.getByText("Cheese")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.queryByText("Pepperoni")).not.toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

The tests are now all passing - we've done it!

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we used a test-driven development approach to write a simple
pizza ordering app. We started by identifying the expected behavior for our app,
including the initial state and what we expect to happen when the user clicks
the checkbox. To simulate the user's action, we used the
[`user-event`][user-event] library.

So far, we've only scratched the surface of the types of user events that can be
tested. We'll learn about more a bit later in the next lesson, where we'll look
at how to test forms in React.
